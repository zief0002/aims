# Lesson Plans

The lesson plans give an overview of the activities for each day of the topic. Ther also outline student goals for the lesson, the materials (e.g., student handouts, data sets) to be used along with discussion questions and lesson wrap-up.

## Suggested Sequence of Lessons

The AIMS lessons are designed to be presented in a particular sequence that we believe will provide an optimal construction of the important main ideas in introductory statistics. The sequence begins with ideas of data collection and production, moving to distribution, center, variability, comparing groups, sampling, inference, and ends with covariation. A detailed sequence of instruction for each of these topics and related activities can be viewed with the materials for each specific topic. These sequences also show how informal aspects of these “big ideas” can be presented prior to their formal introduction in the course and also how they can be revisited after formal instruction on them has taken place.

We want to point out two details about the suggested sequence of activities for the AIMS lessons.

- The number of activities per lesson varies quite a bit. We do not suggest approximate time to spend on each, but rather leave it to the instructor to determine how much time and whether to include or not include certain activities in a particular lesson. For example, you may want to have students do an activity outside class, or many not need one because of a particular assignment you give that gets at the same learning goals.
- The lessons on *Statistical Models and Modeling* appear in two places, rather than in a single, sequential unit. One is included after the first lesson on *Data* and the other two appear after the topic *Comparing Groups*.

A master list of the topics and their associated lessons and activities as provided in the file *00-aims_sequence_of_activities.pdf* (included in the *lesson_plans* folder. A more detailed learning trajectory for each topic is also included in the topic's *material* folder.
