# AIMS Material: Distribution


### Introduction to the Lessons


The two lessons on distribution contain many small activities, which together lead students from exploring one set of data in a simple, intuitive form, to more sophisticated activities that involve comparing and matching graphs. While it is not at all "traditional" to spend two full class sessions on the idea of distribution and basic graphs, we feel strongly that unless students understand this idea early on, they will not understand most of the subsequent course material at a deep level. We also suggest returning to the basic idea of distributions throughout the course, looking at and describing graphs, comparing different representations of the same graph, as they move from empirical to theoretical distributions, and back to empirical ones.
