# AIMS Material: Inference


### Introduction to the Lessons


There are five lessons on statistical inference that begin with informal ideas and lead to running tests of significance and confidence intervals on the computer. The focus is on understanding the ideas and methods and interpreting the results, rather than on formulas and computing test statistics. The lessons proceed very slowly, building on informal ideas from previous lessons and also integrating ideas of argumentation. The final lesson provides students with an opportunity to think statistically and to integrate and apply their knowledge, as they are given only research questions and a data set and need to answer the questions using the data and software.
