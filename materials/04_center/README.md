# AIMS Material: Center


### Introduction to the Lessons


There are two lessons on reasoning about measures of center. They begin with the physical activity described earlier where students manipulate Post-It&reg; notes on a number line to develop an understanding of mean, and then median. Students use a Fathom demo to contrast how the mean and median behave for different types of data sets. Students make and test conjectures about typical values, testing these using software to generate graphs and statistics. The last activity has students compare features and uses of different measures of center when summarizing sample data.
