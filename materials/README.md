# Topics &amp; Materials



The AIMS materials are organized by statistical topic (briefly described below). Each topic has a set of lesson plans (note: a lesson corresponds to a class session, and may include one or more activities), student handouts for each activity, annotated student handouts (which provide sample student responses to selected questions), and sample data sets (data gathered from students that have been used in these activities). In addition, there is a suggested sequence of activities based on the research literature (see Garfield and Ben-Zvi, 2008 for more details).

 - **Data:** The nature and role of data, types of data, and methods of collecting and producing data.
 - **Models and Modeling:** The idea of a statistical model, the uses of models in statistics, essential ideas of probability, the normal distribution and regression as statistical models
 - **Distribution:** The idea of statistical distribution, understanding and interpreting graphical representations of data, introduction to the ideas of shape, center, and spread.
 - **Center:** The idea of center and representativeness; measuring center of a distribution: uses, properties and interpretation of means and medians.
 - **Variability:** The importance of variability in statistical thinking, variation is everywhere, sources of variability; measuring variability of a distribution.
 - **Comparing Groups:** Reasoning with center and variation in comparing groups and making informal inferences, using boxplots.
 - **Samples and Sampling:** Sampling variability and sampling distributions, the effect of sample size, the implications of the Central Limit Theorem.
 - **Inference:** Informal ideas of inference, tests of significance, confidence intervals, _p_-values
 - **Covariation:** Scatterplots, correlation and simple linear regression
