# AIMS Material: Data


### Introduction to the Lessons


There are four lessons on collecting and producing data. They begin with types of data and types of variables, and the variability of data. The lessons provide students with experience using different methods of sampling to develop an appreciation for random sampling, and help students understand different sources of variability and bias in data. Surveys are examined and the impact of question wording is experienced. An experiment is designed and conducted to illustrate principles of random assignment as well as issues involved in designing good experiments. The importance of samples and the role of samples in making inferences are revisited throughout these lessons, as a preliminary introduction to informal ideas of statistical inference.
