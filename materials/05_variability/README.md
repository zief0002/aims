# AIMS Material: Variability


### Introduction to the Lessons


While students have been informally introduced to the idea of spread and range earlier, this set of lessons looks more closely at variability and the standard deviation. First students collect measurements to help them recognize two ways of looking at variability, as noise and as diversity. They informally think about a measure of spread from the center. The second lesson helps develop the idea of standard deviation and encourages students to reason about how this statistic is used to measure and represent variability and factors that affect the standard deviation, making it larger or smaller.
