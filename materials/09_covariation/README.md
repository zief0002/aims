# AIMS Material: Covariation


### Introduction to the Lessons


There are three lessons on covariation, which focus entirely on the concepts and ideas without going into the mathematics. The activities in the lesson lead students to first think about a linear trend in the presence of variability, as they move from examinations of parallel boxplots to a scatterplot to a fitted line. They develop the idea of correlation as a measure of a linear relationship between two variables, and then use the line as a model to explain and make predictions based on this relationship. Finally, students learn to apply ideas of inference to this topic by using tests of significance to test that the correlation coefficient and regression slope are different than zero.
